How to use this repository:

Prerequisites
i. Collect lightcurves into a single directory.
ii. Generate a filelist of the contents of that directory (the lightcurves)
    Command:
    for f in *llc.fits; do echo $f >> filelist; done

If you have calculated features already and they are contained in a .npy file with the right naming convention, skip to step 2.
1. Run keplerml.py to calculate the lightcurve features, this will output a numpy array with the calculated features for each lightcurve.
    Command:
    python keplerml.py
    Choose (or type depending on version of keplerml.py) the path to the directory containing the lightcurves, and the file list.
    Choose a unique identifier for the numpy array, this will be appended to the front of the .npy file.
2. Open ClusterWorkbook.ipynb with ipython notebook.
    Command:
    ipython notebook
    Navigate to ClusterWorkbook
3a. (optional) Determine optimal k for k-means clustering with optimalK.py. This is time consuming and should only be run once per dataset, it outputs to the terminal and does not produce any output files.
    User Input:
    Type the unique identifier of the .npy file
    
3b. Generate k-means clusters with the first module (shift-enter), this generates filelists and numpy arrays for clusters and their outliers. This will all be output to the directory 'clusterOutput', clusters are identified by c# for output files.
    User Input:
    Type the unique identifier of the .npy file you're interested in clustering.
    Input the number of clusters expected (see step 3a for an optimal calculation) 
4. Use 2nd module to plot a 3D scatter of the data, you may choose either k-means or DBSCAN clustering methods, DBSCAN is clustered in module and requires no preclustering.
    User Input:
    Type DBSCAN or kmeans to choose the clustering method (there aren't a lot of allowed typing variations)
    For K-means - Type the identifier for the cluster of interest (should be 'c#')
    
    Click points on the scatter plot to show the lightcurves in the plot below
    Change the axes to view different features in the scatter plot
    
    IMPORTANT: Click 'quit' button to terminate the module properly.
